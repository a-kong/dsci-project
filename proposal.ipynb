    "Forest fires - a particular subtype of wildfires- are uncontrolled fires caused by nature or humans which endanger wildlife and disrupt the ecosystem. Located on the Mediterranean coast, Algeria has a hot and dry climate which increases the rate of evaporation, leaving plants drier than usual. Consequently, the occurrence of forest fires increases. It is thus primordial to combat this environmental issue to prevent global warming and further decimation of Algerian forests. By observing the dataset of the Bejaia region in Algeria, can we use the climate measurements to predict whether a future forest fire will occur in Bejaia? To make this prediction, we will use the Algerian Forest Fires dataset that contains numerical data on relative humidity, wind speed, rain, and temperature and use these variables as predictors to foresee the possible occurrence of forest fires in the Bejaia region in order to take the necessary precautions to prevent the fire propagation and protect the ecosystem.\n"
